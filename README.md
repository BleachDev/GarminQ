GarminQ is an [Experience sampling Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_sampling_method) app for Garmin watches, which lets you create simple questions (experiments) which triggers throughout the day or over longer periods of time and logs your responses.  

By recording your responses in real-time, GarminQ can provide invaluable insights into your behavioral patterns, mood fluctuation and daily experiences.

Data can be easily exported from your watch to any device to be used for visualizing, data analysis or anything else! Additional data such as Current Activity, Heart Rate and Body Battery is also attached to your responses which gives even more insight into your data.
